Crazy Cat People WAR

- This game of war is primarily focused on the basic rules of the WAR cardgame.  

-As it is currently still being created, in the future it will primarily have functionality leaned into determining who which participant of a couple will be handling pet related tasks as they arise.  Tasks such as cleaning a litterbox, feeding the cat, or administering the cat's medication.  These decisions will be made using the power of WAR!  
- As an added bonus, it will allow users to enter in tasks as they see fit and log date, participants, task and results to ensure that a record is kept of wins/losses.
- Future versions may include color mood borders based on continuous wins/losses in a row and animated fast/slow card draws.
